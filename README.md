# ErrorHandling

This project is a simple smart contract created in Solidity that applies different error-handling methods, such as require(), revert(), assert().

## Description

The ErrorHandling contract is a simple smart contract that handles token operations. It allows the minting and burning tokens, sending tokens between addresses, and depositing tokens into user balances. The contract includes error handling mechanisms using require() statements to validate conditions and revert transactions if necessary. It also defines a custom error type, InsufficientBalance, for handling cases of insufficient balance during token transfers. The contract's state variables store the token name, abbreviation, total supply, and balances of different addresses.

## Getting Started

### Installation

- Copy and paste the code in IDEs that support Solidity. I highly recommend using Remix, a well-known online tool for developing smart contracts.

### Executing the Program

- Compile the code (Make sure to match the compiler version according to the code)
- Deploy the smart contract
